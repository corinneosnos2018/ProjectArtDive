      <div class="container bot">"Cells interlinked within cells, interlinked<br>
Within one stem, and dreadfully distinct.<br>
Against the dark, a tall white fountain played..." </div>
      
<div class="container bot">Did you see the first one?</div>
      
<div class="container bot">Yes No</div>
      
<div class="container user">Yes</div>
      
<div class="container bot">This sequel was written by the same screenwriter as the first movie, and builds on a lot of the same themes about the limits of artificial intelligence and the morality of abandoning the societies we created. And it's got a knockout ending.<br>
      Did you like this one or the original better?</div>
      
<div class="container bot">Original 2049</div>
      
<div class="container user">Original</div>
      
<div class="container bot">Yeah, the original was more striking. It basically created the entire visual palette of '80s sci-fi.</div>
      
<div class="container bot">What questions do you have about the movie?</div>
      
<div class="container user">What was that ending about?</div>
      
<div class="container bot">Hang on, let me connect you with a critic!</div>
      
<div class="container bot"><img src=images/ellipsis.gif></div>
      
<div class="container critic">Hi, this is Andrew Lapin -- I'm a film critic with NPR. Excited to talk with you about "Blade Runner 2049"!</div>

<div class="container critic">I see you were wondering about the ending. Personally, I thought it was a beautiful ending. K has just taken on this huge quest because he thought there was a chance he was human. It's a shock when he learns he's not, yet he has still chosen to sacrifice himself for the greater good -- which is the most "human" thing a person can do.</div>    
      
<div class="container critic">It's a reverse of the conundrum from the first movie, where the hero begins thinking he is a human, but gradually doubts his own humanity over the course of the film.</div>
      
<div class="container user">What is with that replicant diagnostics test?</div>
      
<div class="container critic">They are quoting Vladimir Nabokov's novel "Pale Fire," a book with a lot of thematic similarities to "2049." Both stories feature unreliable narrators, and both feature characters questioning their purpose on Earth.</div>

      <div class="container critic"><a href="https://medium.com/@mariabustillos/blade-runner-2049-is-revealed-through-the-novel-pale-fire-dd9f04768439">Here's a great piece elaborating on those themes.</a></div> 
      
      <div class="container critic">Is there anything else you want to talk about?</div>
      
      <div class="container user">That's it, thank you. I enjoyed the movie!</div>
      
      <div class="container critic">I'm glad! It's very inventive. For a dissenting opinion, check out this <a href="https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/blade-runner-2049">two-star review in <em>Slant</em> magazine.</a></div>
